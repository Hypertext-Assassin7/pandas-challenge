Summary of Analysis

Local Government Area Summary:
The education in that local area seems to be of a relatively high quality, as both the reading and maths score is on average 70 out of 100. If you were to send your child to any of these 15 schools in that area, they would likely do better than average (i.e., better than 50 out of a 100) in reading and maths. 

School Summary:
•	Government schools have more students than Private schools. Reason being Government schools are free of charge and Private schools are fee paying. Hence only kids whose parents are financially well-off can attend Private schools. Subsequently Government schools will also have larger school budgets than Private schools. 
•	Spend per student is relatively close between Government and Private schools (i.e., difference of less than $100). This means even though Private school students pay fees they still receive similar spend per student as Government schools.
•	Average maths and reading scores for each school is relatively close to the average across all the schools. This means the standard of education across all 15 schools is of a similar high standard.

Top 5 performing schools:
Regardless of if your child attends a Government or Private school, the school budget or school size (total students) they would likely obtain an extremely high reading and maths passing score of 80% or greater (50% being the minimum passing score).

Bottom 5 performing schools:
The bottom performing schools are Government schools (4 out of 5). These schools obtained lower grades on average reading scores than average maths scores which subsequently dropped their overall passing score to be between 60-70%.   

Maths scores by Year Level:
All students obtained very consistent average maths scores across year 9, 10, 11 and 12 regardless of whether they attended a Government or Private school. 

Reading scores by Year Level:
All students obtained very consistent average reading scores across year 9, 10, 11 and 12 regardless of whether they attended a Government or Private school. 

Performance by school spending:
It does not matter if a school spends more or slightly less per student on average the student’s maths and reading results are remarkably similar and of a high standard. 

Performance by school size:
Smaller schools (less than 1000 students) obtained on average a higher overall passing mark of about 10% better then larger schools (2000-5000 students). This could be due to smaller schools having better student to teacher ratios than larger schools. 

Performance by school type:
Both Government and Private schools obtained on average similar overall passing scores.

Conclusions
•	Whether you choose to send your kids to a Government school or Private school in this local area, regardless of school size or budget they are likely to obtain an exceedingly high standard of education in reading and arithmetic.
•	However, to give your child a slight edge a smaller school of around 1000-2000 students is ideal. These schools have better student to teacher ratios and therefore your child will get longer one-on-one attention with their teachers.
